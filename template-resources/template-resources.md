Using Web templates and frameworks will help you create prototypes more quickly and will also ensure that those prototypes bear a close resemblance to your comps and mockups. Whether you develop your own framework from scratch or use a popular one, such as Foundation or Bootstrap, get to know it inside out, and keep refining it to suit your needs.

Also, build your own “boilerplate” HTML5 file, which is a minimal basic file that serves as the starting point for any Web page you create. HTML5 Boilerplate is a good place to start. You’ll also find it worthwhile to create a skeleton website, set up with a file structure for images, CSS and JavaScript. Build yourself a basic CSS file that you can drop into any project. Add it all to the toolkit.
