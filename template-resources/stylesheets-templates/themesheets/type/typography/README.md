Typesetting is "is the process of arranging or composing of text ready for print"

Typography is "the art and technique of arranging text so that it is visually appealing and readable"
Orthography is "arranging letters to spelling correctly"

Type Family - You didn't mention this but it's important. The design of all the characters comprised of a family and all its encompassing faces. Helvetica is a type family. Helvetica Condensed is a type family, Myriad Pro is a type family, etc.

Typeface - the specific weight or instance of a particular family. I.E. Bold, italic, oblique are all typefaces. Typeface is generally referred to by family + face. For example Helvetica Bold Italic would be referred to as the typeface where Helvetica is the Family and Bold Italic is the face.

Font - Refers to the computer software file which contains information regarding the display and output of a typeface. You choose a font from the typeface menu. Fonts only exist on a computer. In the world today many use the word "Font" incorrectly -- "oh, I like that font." is wrong. It should be "Oh, I like that typeface." However, "Which font did you pick for that Photoshop design?" would be correct. Whereas, "What font is used in this logo?" is incorrect (should be typeface).

Font Face - (somewhat interchangeable with typeface) the face of the type family. For example Bold or Italic are a face where as Helvetica would be the family. Referencing "font", font face specifically refers to the software used to render a particular face of a family - You may have Helvetica bold as a font face, but not Helvetica italic.


    font-family = either a specific or generic name for a computer font (digital file). Specific names would be something like Helvetica. Generic names would be something like monospace. As for style (italics, etc) weight (bold, etc) and such, these are all set via different CSS styles.

  @font-face = a way to load a digital font file and then refer to said font-file via CSS's font-family.  This isn't really a typographic term outside of CSS's @font-face

  additional secondary attributes = these dictate other aspects of the font beyond family and include:
    1. font-weight (bold, thin, book, etc),
    2. font-style (italics, etc),
    3. font-size (12pt, 40px, etc),
    4. text-transform (allcaps, etc), and others.


  *typeface vs. font* = this is where things get really vague. Traditionally, a typeface was a particular style of lettering. So, for example, Futura Font was a specific cut of said typeface. By cut, that is in the literal sense in that it was either cut from wood, or metal (or cast in metal). So Futura would be a typeface and Futura Bold 12pt would be a particular font.
