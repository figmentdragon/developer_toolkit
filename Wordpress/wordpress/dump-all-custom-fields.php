<!--WordPress has a built in function, the_meta(), for outputting all custom fields. But this function is limited in that it doesnâ€™t always output all of them. For example, it misses custom fields added by plugins which begin with an _ underscore.

This bit of code uses an alternate function, get_post_custom() which will return all of them, and display all values. Good for debugging.-->

<h3>All Post Meta</h3>

<?php

  // Get all the data
  $getPostCustom = get_post_custom();

    foreach($getPostCustom as $name=>$value) {

        echo "<strong>" . $name . "</strong>"."  =>  ";

        foreach ($value as $nameAr=>$valueAr) {
                echo "<br />";
                echo $nameAr."  =>  ";
                echo var_dump($valueAr);
        }

        echo "<br /><br />";

    }
?>
