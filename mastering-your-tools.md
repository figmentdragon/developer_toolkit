Mastering Your Tools #

It might sound like I am suggesting that you keep reusing the same look and techniques across all of your work, but that is not the case. I am suggesting that you consciously limit your toolset, and then absolutely master those tools. You can then refine them according to project briefs, client feedback and your own inclination.

Keep experimenting with your favorite tools. This year, inspired by Kevin Dartâ€™s Colouroids, I set myself a challenge to create one vector image a day, to really master Illustrator. In these self-set projects, go outside of your comfort zone and try a new approach, process or technique.
