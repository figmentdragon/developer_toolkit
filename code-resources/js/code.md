As with graphics, you’ll inevitably find yourself wanting to use the same bits of code from one project to the next. Rather than constantly reinvent the wheel, reuse classes and functions and keep refining them.

If you work with a language such as Java or ActionScript, which support classes, then you’ll find yourself returning to the same third-party classes and libraries time and again, so keep them handy in your toolkit, and take the time to really understand them.

For other languages, such as JavaScript, group together functions that you commonly use in a self-contained .js library file. You can then keep this as part of your toolkit, or use a content delivery network such as CDN.net, so that you can directly reference it from your project.

Add to this, of course, essential third-party libraries, such as Modernizr and Require.js — I’m sure you have your own favorites — and any add-ons, such as small JavaScript libraries. Keep them somewhere handy, to be able to quickly drop them into a project.

Another place to put code libraries and classes is on a hosted version-control website, such as GitHub, Beanstalk or, my personal choice, Bitbucket. This is especially useful if you like to tinker and refine code or if you want to share your toolkit with other developers. If you want to open-source your code and make it publicly accessible, then GitHub or Google Code is ideal.

Another place to store code is Snipplr. As the name suggests, it’s great for storing little snippets of code — for example, code to retrieve the current date — that you’ll need time and again. You can make your snippets public or keep them to yourself. Snipplr is ideal for storing those little code hacks that you keep forgetting.
