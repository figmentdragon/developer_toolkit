/**
 *RESPONSIVE HELPER FUNCTION
 *If you're creating a responsive site, then
 *you've probably already read
 *Responsive Web Design: http://www.abookapart.com/products/responsive-web-design
 *
 *Here's a nice little helper function for calculating
 *target / context
 *as mentioned in that book.
 *
 *Example:
 *width: cp(650px, 1000px);
 *or
 *width: calc-percent(650px, 1000px);
 *both compile to:
 *width: 65%;
 */

@function cp($target, $container) {
  @return calc-percent($target, $container);
