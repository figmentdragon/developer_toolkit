COLOR FUNCTIONS
These are helpful when you're working
with shadows and such things. It's essentially
a quicker way to write RGBA.

Example:
box-shadow: 0 0 4px black(0.3);
compiles to:
box-shadow: 0 0 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.3);
*********************/

// black
@function black($opacity) {
    @return rgba(0,0,0,$opacity);
}

// white
@function white($opacity) {
    @return rgba(255,255,255,$opacity);
}
