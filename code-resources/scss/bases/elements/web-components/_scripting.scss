// In order to create dynamic content and Web applications, HTML supports the use of scripting languages, most prominently JavaScript. Certain elements support this capability.

// Canvas - Use the HTML <canvas> element with either the canvas scripting API or the WebGL API to draw graphics and animations.

canvas {
    display: inline-block;
    vertical-align: baseline;
