Illustration is one area in which your personal style can really shine through, so build a resource of vector elements. Having a collection of killer elements on hand is a great way to dive into a project and get inspiration. I’ve been slowly adding elements to my vector doodads Illustrator file for a couple of years now, inspired by the efforts of DesignBum, who has made a number of his project files available for downloading.

You’ll find yourself reusing certain background elements and textures; so, again, carefully select a few ones, and add them to your toolkit. Don’t worry about overusing these images — use them in comps and mockups, and then, once you have finalized the design, if you feel that you need a fresh image, go and find one. This will save you time from hunting for new images for every mockup.

You may find an online repository such as LayerVault or Pixelapse to be useful for storing image and vector assets, especially if you collaborate with other designers and want to share your toolkit with them.
