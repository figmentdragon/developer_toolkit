Fonts are a prime cause of bloat. Over 300 fonts are in my font library, which I manage using Font Agent Pro (available for both Mac and Windows), but I find myself using the same 10 or so for most commercial work, and many of the 300 I’ll probably never use. Sifting through all of them is a real time sink, so I have a couple of sets with all of my go-to typefaces, which I have copied in Dropbox. The same applies to Web-based type management, such as Typekit. Find great type combinations that work for you, and use them repeatedly. It’s a part of how you establish your own recognizable style. Add new typefaces to your core collection sparingly.
